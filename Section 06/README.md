# Section 6: OOP Part 1 - Classes, Constructors and Inheritance


First OOP parts

# What I Learned
* Fields are variable inside class
* Class can be thanked as user defined data type
* protected allows package level to access itself
* Fields should be private if else not needed
* State is declared as fields of the class
* When creating class, we need initialize it 
* For class default state is `null`
	* String also a class, there fore it has also default `null`
