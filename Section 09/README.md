Inner and Abstract Classes & Interfaces

# What I Learned
* Interface is abstract
* ITelephone
	* I is telling its interface
* Java library is using a lot interfaces
*`Vector<~>` is one kind of list
* Implement interface or inherit from base class
	* relations between object decides
* `List<String> values = new ArrayList<String>()`
	* Preferred way writing List
		* Maxium flexibility since List is more generic version of the list
* `public class Player implements ISaveable {...}`
	* We can use this class where ISaveable is defined in method signature
