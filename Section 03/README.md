# Section 3: First Steps

All the ingredient what first steps needs

# What I Learned
* Clarifying meanings of different primitive types
* Refresh on casting operation
* Chars were more used in the past than nowadays, due to saving of memory
* Chars are 16-bit, not 8, coz we need to store unicode in it
	* Unicode allows us to represent languages and scripts with two bytes
* [Unicode Table](https://unicode-table.com/en/) 
* String in Java are immutable
* You should always use code block when using if
* Default values when Java is operating:
	* Whole numbers Int is assumed in use
		* `x = 1 + 1` x is assumer Int
	* Number with decimal value Double is assumed in use
		* `x = 1.1 + 1.1` x is assumer Double
* Ternary operator(always forget structure of this operator), this is usefull
	* `boolean wasCar = isCar ? true : false`
		* 3 operands, ternary operator name itself refers `something which takes 3 operands`
		* 1st operand condition if its true or false
			* if `true` assign 2nd operand expression/value to wasCar
			* if `false` assign 3nd operand expression/value to wasCar
